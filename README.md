# Owe
Small application for your directories to be **o**rganized **w**ith **e**ase

The programm basically searches through your selected directory and looks for subdirectories containing any kind of files and creating thus a list of those. Directories can be opened as usual by a double-click or by selecting and pressing ENTER. 

As for the current version 0.1, the functions 'Search' and 'Find Similar' are implemented which should be self-explanatory.
